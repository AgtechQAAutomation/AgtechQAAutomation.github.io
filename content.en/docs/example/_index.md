Agriculture is shaped by countless variables that are often difficult to observe in real time — fluctuations in crop performance, execution gaps across field teams, compliance risks, and hidden quality issues. These blind spots make large-scale agriculture hard to manage, audit, and scale with confidence.

**RAITHU** is built to bring complete visibility and control to agricultural operations. By combining remote sensing intelligence, field-level data capture, and secure, immutable digital records, RAITHU ensures that every action and outcome across the crop lifecycle is traceable, verifiable, and trusted. From the moment a seed is planted to the final settlement with a farmer, organizations gain real-time insight into production, execution, and compliance.

With RAITHU, agriculture becomes:
- **Transparent** — every activity is recorded and auditable  
- **Predictable** — risks and performance issues are identified early  
- **Scalable** — operations can grow across regions, farmers, and seasons with confidence  

This user manual is designed to guide you through the core concepts, workflows, and features of the RAITHU platform, helping you effectively manage agricultural programs at scale.

## Core Platform Concept: Organization

The foundation of RAITHU is the **Organization**.

Every user operates within an organization, which represents an agri company, enterprise, or program managing farmers and fields. Access to an organization is granted through invitations, ensuring secure and controlled onboarding.

Within an organization, administrators can:
- Configure workforce roles and permissions  
- Define operational and compliance policies  
- Manage farmers, fields, and crop cycles  
- Monitor execution and performance across regions  

All other features and workflows in RAITHU are built on top of this organizational structure.

The upcoming sections of this manual will walk through organization setup, workforce configuration, policy management, and day-to-day operational workflows in detail.
