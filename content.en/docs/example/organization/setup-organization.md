## Organization Setup – Profile & Region Configuration

After logging in to the RAITHU platform, users can configure organization-level and role-based regional settings through the **Profile Settings** page. These settings define how regions are assigned and how operations are structured across the organization.

Regional configuration is essential for organizing field activities, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring data is captured and reported at the correct geographic level.

### Accessing Organization Setup

1. Log in to your RAITHU account.
2. Click on your **Profile** icon.
3. Navigate to **Profile Settings**.

Within this section, users can configure region-related settings that control operational scope and data visibility.

### Region Configuration Options

The Profile Settings page allows users to define the following regions:

#### Default Region

The **Default Region** represents the primary geographic level for the organization.  
This region is used as the baseline for organizing farmers, fields, and operational data.

Selecting a default region helps standardize how locations are grouped and reported across the platform.

---

#### Supervisor Operating Region

The **Supervisor Operating Region** defines the geographic level at which supervisors operate.  
This setting determines the scope of responsibility for supervisory roles, enabling efficient oversight of field teams and activities within assigned regions.

---

#### Field Technician Operating Region

The **Field Technician Operating Region** specifies the geographic level at which field technicians perform daily operations such as inspections, data collection, and field visits.

By setting this level, the organization ensures that field technicians focus on precise, manageable areas, improving execution accuracy and accountability.

### Why Regional Setup Matters

Proper region configuration enables:
- Clear assignment of operational responsibilities  
- Structured reporting and data aggregation  
- Efficient workforce management across locations  
- Improved traceability and audit readiness  

These settings form the foundation for downstream workflows such as farmer onboarding, task assignment, monitoring, and performance analysis.

The next sections of this manual will explain how regions are created, managed, and used throughout the RAITHU platform.
