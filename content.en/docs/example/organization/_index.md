## Organization

An **Organization** is the core structural unit in the RAITHU platform. It represents an agri company, enterprise, cooperative, or program that manages farmers, fields, and agricultural operations at scale.

All data, users, and workflows in RAITHU exist within the context of an organization. This ensures secure access control, clear ownership of information, and consistent execution of policies across regions and seasons.

### What an Organization Includes

An organization in RAITHU typically consists of:
- Registered users and field teams with defined roles and permissions  
- Farmers and their associated fields and crop cycles  
- Operational policies, quality standards, and compliance rules  
- Execution data such as inspections, inputs, harvests, and settlements  

This structure allows organizations to manage large and distributed agricultural operations in a standardized and traceable manner.

### Access and Management

Organizations are created through the sign-up process or accessed via invitation. Only authorized users can view or manage organization data based on their assigned roles.

Organization administrators can:
- Invite and manage users  
- Configure workforce roles and access levels  
- Define operational and compliance policies  
- Monitor execution and performance across all fields and regions

### Why Organizations Matter

By organizing all activities under a single organizational framework, RAITHU enables:
- End-to-end traceability across farmers and supply chains  
- Consistent execution of agricultural programs  
- Improved accountability and audit readiness  
- Scalable operations across locations and seasons  

All other features in RAITHU build on this organizational foundation, making it the central pillar of the platform.
